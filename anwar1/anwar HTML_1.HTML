         <h2>history</h2>
         Lebanese cuisine has ancient roots and is part of the culinary tradition of the Eastern Mediterranean. Many dishes in
        Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of Phoenician, Persian, Egyptian, Neo-Babylonian,
         Roman, Greek, Byzantine, Arab and Ottoman rule.<b>[16][17]</b> In the last 500 years, Lebanese cuisine has been influenced
         by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the Ottoman Turks controlled Lebanon and
         introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with lamb. After the
         Ottomans were defeated in World War I (1914â€“1918), France took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country
         achieved its independence. The French introduced foods such as flan, caramel custard, eclairs, french fries and
         croissants.<b>[18]</b>

         The Lebanese diaspora who live worldwide have introduced new ingredients, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese
         cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<b>[19][20]</b> Chef and writer Tara
         Khattar describes her style of cookery as 'progressive Lebanese cuisine'.<b>[21]</b>
